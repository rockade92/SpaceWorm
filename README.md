# SpaceWorm
A snake-like game prototype made with  [Godot engine](http://godotengine.org) where you can also run into enemies.

I made this project to learn Godot and test various features. The scripts are written in gdscript.

### Things I learned
 - How to switch scenes
 - How to use fonts
 - Window / Full screen
 - Physics and collisions 2D
 - How to spawn random object using factories
 - Collisions layers
 - How to add and remove instances with code
 - Connect an event on a UI element to a script
 - How to use signals (Godotâ€™s version of the observer pattern)
